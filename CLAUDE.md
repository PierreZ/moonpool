# Claude Context for Moonpool

## Project Overview
Moonpool is a Rust project designed to create the right toolbox for building distributed systems. The project is structured as a workspace with multiple components.

## Current Focus: Simulation Framework
Currently working on the simulation framework located in `moonpool-simulation`. This is a deterministic simulation framework for testing distributed systems.

## Current Task
- Review existing simulation spec from gist
- Modify and improve the specification
- Generate new spec in docs/specs/simulation
- Current branch: spec

## Project Structure
- `moonpool-simulation/` - Main simulation framework implementation
- `docs/references/` - Reference code from other projects for inspiration

## Key Questions to Explore
- What specific changes are needed to the existing spec?
- What aspects of distributed systems testing need more focus?
- How does this simulation framework fit into the broader moonpool toolbox?
