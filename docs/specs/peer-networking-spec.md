## NetworkProvider Trait

### Core Interface

The NetworkProvider trait abstracts network operations to enable seamless switching between simulation and real networking:

**Connection Creation:**
- `connect(addr: &str) -> Result<TcpStream, Error>`: Establish outbound connections
- Address resolution and connection establishment
- Error handling for unreachable hosts and connection failures

**Server Creation:**
