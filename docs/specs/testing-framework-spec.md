# Testing Framework Specification

## Overview

The Moonpool Testing Framework provides comprehensive chaos testing and statistical assertion capabilities for distributed systems. This specification describes the buggify system, sometimes assertions, and multi-seed testing infrastructure that enables finding bugs before production deployment.

## Design Philosophy

**Core Principle: Find Bugs Before Production**

The framework is designed to torture distributed systems with infrastructure conditions worse than any production environment. By simulating catastrophic network failures, extreme delays, and chaotic fault combinations, we expose bugs that would otherwise only surface during production disasters.

**Hostile Infrastructure by Default:**
- Network delays 10x worse than production
- Packet loss rates that would cripple real systems
- Connection failures at the worst possible moments
- Combinations of faults that create perfect storms
- Time dilation to expose race conditions

## Buggify Chaos Testing System

### Core Concept

Inspired by FoundationDB's proven chaos testing approach, the buggify system provides randomized fault injection at strategic points throughout the codebase.

**Strategic Injection Philosophy:**
- Place buggify points where faults would expose the most bugs
- Target critical junctions: before/after network operations, during state transitions
- Focus on synchronization points, resource allocation/deallocation
- Emphasize protocol boundaries and error handling paths

### Buggify API

**Basic Usage:**
- `buggify!(probability)` - Probabilistic fault injection (0.0 to 1.0)
- `buggify_range(min, max)` - Random value generation within range
- Deterministic behavior through thread-local seeded RNG
- Same seed always produces same sequence of buggify decisions

**Integration with Thread-Local RNG:**
- Uses deterministic ChaCha8Rng for reproducible randomization
- Thread-local storage for clean API without explicit RNG passing
- Seed-based initialization for controlled test reproduction
- Compatible with single-core simulation execution model

### Fault Categories

**Network Buggify:**
- Random packet loss and connection failures
- Unexpected delays and timeout scenarios
- Connection establishment failures at critical moments
- Half-open connection simulation

**Timing Buggify:**
- Unexpected delays during critical operations
- Early timeout conditions to test recovery logic
- Clock skew and time dilation scenarios
- Race condition exposure through timing manipulation

**Resource Buggify:**
- Memory pressure and allocation failures
- File descriptor exhaustion scenarios
- Buffer overflow and capacity limit testing
- Resource cleanup and leak detection

**Logic Buggify:**
- State corruption and invalid state transitions
- Protocol violation injection
- Message corruption and malformed data
- Boundary condition and edge case exposure

### Configuration

**BuggifyConfig:**
- Global enable/disable control for production safety
- Per-category probability tuning for targeted testing
- Integration with simulation framework for coordinated chaos
- Runtime configuration changes for dynamic testing scenarios

## Assertions System

### Always Assertions

**Purpose:** Validate invariants that must never be violated

**Characteristics:**
- Must always evaluate to true
- Represents system invariants and safety properties
- Failures indicate critical bugs requiring immediate attention
- Used for fundamental correctness validation

**Strategic Placement:**
- System invariants (leader election, consensus safety)
- Data consistency checks
- Resource management validation
- Protocol correctness verification

### Sometimes Assertions

**Purpose:** Statistical validation of system behavior under chaos

**Characteristics:**
- Should be true in some percentage of cases
- Enables comprehensive edge case exploration
- Statistical coverage tracking across multiple test runs
- Validates error handling and recovery paths

**Coverage Philosophy:**
- Target 100% sometimes assertion coverage through chaos testing
- Each assertion should trigger across multiple seeds/iterations
- Statistical analysis identifies under-tested code paths
- Continuous improvement through coverage gap analysis

**Strategic Placement:**
- Performance expectations (consensus completion time)
- Error recovery scenarios (successful retry after failure)
- Resource utilization patterns (queue capacity utilization)
- Network condition responses (timeout handling effectiveness)

### Implementation

**Macro Design:**
- Clean, readable syntax for easy adoption

## Multi-Seed Testing Infrastructure

### Core Concept

**Comprehensive Edge Case Exploration:**
Each test runs with multiple different seeds to comprehensively test edge cases. This approach is crucial for distributed systems where rare random sequences can expose subtle bugs that would otherwise remain hidden.

### Execution Model

**Isolated Runtime Per Seed:**
- Each seed gets a fresh Tokio runtime configured with specific randomization
- Complete isolation prevents cross-contamination between test iterations
- Deterministic seeding ensures reproducible behavior within each iteration
- Statistical aggregation across all seed iterations for comprehensive analysis

**Seed Strategy:**
- Random seed generation for broad coverage
- Fixed seed collections for regression testing
- Hybrid approaches combining random and targeted seeds
- Failing seed capture and reproduction for debugging

### Workload Registration System

**Flexible Test Definition:**
- Async workload functions with seed-based parameterization
- Multiple workloads per test suite for comprehensive system coverage
- Clean separation between test logic and execution infrastructure
- Type-safe workload results with detailed error information

**Execution Coordination:**
- Parallel execution across multiple seeds for performance
- Result aggregation and statistical analysis
- Failure isolation and detailed error reporting
- Progress tracking and execution monitoring

## Simulation Report System
